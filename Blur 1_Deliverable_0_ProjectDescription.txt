Samsung Health: The Samsung Health app allows you to keep track of some of the core aspects of fitness, such as exercise, food, sleep, and weight management. It can pair with wearables to gather data such as heart rate and steps. It has a section with social features, a section to check for medical conditions and symptoms, and a section on health and wellness related articles. It has a few features that make the process of health tracking a little more automatic, such as being able to detect walking or running, and calculating when you've gone to sleep.

Fitbit: The Fitbit app allows you to track many aspects of your fitness. The Fitbit app is designed to be used with a wearable Fitbit but the aspects can be manually recorded. Fitbit can track calories, exercise, water, food, and sleep all on a customizable dashboard. Fitbit also allows you to set goals and compete with other users. Our app would allow the user to track these different health aspects but would not focus on gathering data from a wearable device. Our app would be an all in one fitness app for anyone to record health data without needing a specific wearable device, or subscription.
